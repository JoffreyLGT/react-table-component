The goal of this project is to make a React table component that is:
- displaying the data that we are giving it ;
- is filterable ;
- is sortable.

The project is currently using the libraries:
- https://bulma.io/       => For quick styling.
- https://fontawesome.com => To display some icons.

Notes: The librairies above are temporary and will be removed when the table will be finished to make it lightweight.
